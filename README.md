# Lists
A Simple ToDo App is built using the MVC Architecture, implemented local "authorization" so people can sign up, customize & personalize the app

# How It's Made:

I made this using the MVC structure in Node.js with Express and MongoDB. I used EJS for embedding JavaScript into my HTML layouts, mongoose for list and user schemas for the DB, passport & passport-local for "authorization".

## Tech used: 
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Bootstrap**

## Packages/Dependencies used 

bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

## Optimizations

**Things I would like to add in the future:**

**Design:**
- icons for delete button
- add more styling

**Functionality:**
- add due date
- make nested lists within the list
- make todo items editable


## Lessons Learned:

Pushed .env file, had to delete the repo and start over so all git save points are lost. Need to be sure to include the .env in my .gitignore immediately when creating apps.
